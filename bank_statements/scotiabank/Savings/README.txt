This folder is meant to contain SAVINGS accounts.
In this folder make a folder for EACH savings account, and store PDFs as such.
Example: 'MoneyMaster' account can be called as such here as the folder name, then dump all bank statement PDFs here.
**Do NOT adjust names of files, script assumes they are called the defaults assigned by Scotiabank Online.
